## tictactoe.js
A js version of tic tac toe. Created as homework from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript), mainly to practice using factory functions and the module pattern. The result is somewhat dry, but functional spaghetti.

## How to use it
The game can be found online [here](https://vilsl.github.io/odinproject-tictactoe/).

## Built with
Just standard Javascript.

## Disclaimer
It might break on some resolutions or zoom levels.
